First we created a single DFA for Identifiers, integers, string, comment, realtional operators and IO operators. Then we moved one and wrote the regular definition of these by consulting 
the DFA. Lastly we did the coding part by writing a program that identifies token and their respevctive lexenes for keywords, relational operators, special characters, arithmetic operators,
other constructs, strings, comments, assignment operator, starting block, closing block and IO operators. We followed both the DFA (i.e it's states represent cases) and regular defintion 
(i.e for token names) while coding for dentifiers, integers, string, comment, realtional operators and IO operators while the others were did so independently. We did not encounter any 
problems whiile doing the assignment and were able to complete it without any hassle.
